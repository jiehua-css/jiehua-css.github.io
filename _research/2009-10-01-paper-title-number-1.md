Welcome to my personal academic homepage!
</p>
<p class="bio-text"> 
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Demography at the School of Population and Health, Renmin University of China, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://litingkitty.cn/" target="_blank">Ting Li</a>. My research focuses on marriage and family, and I am committed to extending computational methods to classic demographic topics, particularly integrating multi-source data. I am also interested in public health, including simulating population health and exploring social stratification in health communication.
