I am a PhD Candidate in Demography at the School of Population and Health, Renmin University of China. My research focuses on marriage and family, and I am committed to extending computational methods to classic demographic topics, particularly integrating multi-source data. I am also interested in public health, including simulating population health and exploring social stratification in health communication.
